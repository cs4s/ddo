# Midday Workshop

## Coding and Computational Thinking

You may have heard of initiatives like the [Hour of Code](https://code.org/learn){:target="_blank"} or have read articles that argue that [all students should learn how to code](https://theconversation.com/an-education-for-the-21st-century-means-teaching-coding-in-schools-42046){:target="_blank"}.
Coding and Computational Thinking are now included as core concepts in the new [Digital Technologies](http://www.australiancurriculum.edu.au/technologies/digital-technologies/curriculum/f-10?layout=1){:target="_blank"} learning area of the national curriculum. 
BOSTES has also recommended incorporating Coding and Computational thinking across the NSW syllabuses and has created [a guide to help teachers do this](http://k6.boardofstudies.nsw.edu.au/wps/portal/go/science-and-technology/statement-on-coding){:target="_blank"}.

In this workshop we will work through two activities that can be used to teach Coding and Computational Thinking. 
The first activity is titled *My Robotic Friends*. This activity has been designed to demonstrate the importance of the need for precision when Coding.
The second activity is an *Introduction to Scratch*. 
Scratch is a tool for creating interactive stories, animations and games that is often used for teaching Coding and Computational Thinking in Primary Schools.

The materials for these activities are available on the [activities page](activities).

## Who We Are

We are *Dr Elena Prieto* and *Mr Daniel Hickmott*, from the School of Education at the University of Newcastle. 

## November Primary School Workshop

We will be running a free two day, BOSTES accredited professional development workshop on November 21 and 22 for pre-service and in-service Primary School teachers. This workshop will involve:

- An introduction to Coding, Computer Science and Computational Thinking
- Hands-on activities with Coding, Robots and AppInventor
- Presentations from educators that have integrated Computer Science activities into their classrooms

You can find out more about these workshops and find a link to the registration form on the [University of Newcastle CS4S Website](http://newcastle.edu.au/cs4s){:target="_blank"}.
