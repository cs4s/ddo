# Teacher Workshop

## Purpose
This workshop is intended to be a quick introduction to [Scratch](http://scratch.mit.edu){:target="_blank"}. Scratch is a tool for 
creating interactive stories, animations and games. We have provided a few activities that you can explore at your own pace. 
If you're already familiar with Scratch or have any questions about it - please let us know.

## Who We Are
We are *Dr Elena Prieto* and *Mr Daniel Hickmott*, from the School of Education at the University of Newcastle. We have been running 
2 day professional development workshops for teachers since 2013. These workshops include:

- An introduction to Computational Thinking
- Hands-on activities with Coding, Robots and AppInventor
- Examples of the applications of Computer Science in research and industry
- Presentations from educators that have integrated Computer Science activities into their classrooms

There is more information about these workshops available [here](http://newcastle.edu.au/cs4s){:target="_blank"}.

## Future Professional Development Opportunities
We are running a CS4S workshop for Primary School teachers in November. Registration for this workshop has not opened yet.
