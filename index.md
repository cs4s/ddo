# Teacher Workshop

## Purpose
This workshop is intended to be a quick introduction to Scratch. Scratch is a tool for creating animations, games and other programs. 
We have provided a few activities that you can explore at your own pace. If you're already familiar with Scratch or have any questions 
about it - please let us know.

## Who We Are
We are Dr Elena Prieto and Mr Daniel Hickmott, from the School of Education at the University of Newcastle. We have been running 
professional development workshops, titled Computer Science 4 Schools, since 2013. These workshops are focused on the teaching of 
Computational Thinking.

## Future Professional Development Opportunities
We are running a CS4S workshop for Primary School teachers in November. Registration for this workshop has not opened yet. 
However, if you would like to be notified when registration opens, or would like to know about other professional development 
oppurtunities in this area, please fill in this form.
